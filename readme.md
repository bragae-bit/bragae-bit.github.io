My Name is Eric and this is my website. I hope to include the beginning of my data science adventure here.

DATA SETS:

Sweden Statistics (https://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/) especially the specific life table (https://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/START__BE__BE0701/LivslUtbLan/)
      This table gives census information of Sweden and the specific life table is about education level, sex and age by county.
      With Sweden being one of the happiest countries in the world for a number of years now perhaps we can gleam some knowledge from their        statistics. I always thought education level played a part in happiness and this could help figure out if that is the case.
