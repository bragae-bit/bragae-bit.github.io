My Name is Eric, and this is my website. I hope to include the beginning of my data science adventure here.

## **Data Sets:**

### Sweden Statistics ([https://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/](url)) especially the specific life table ([https://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/START__BE__BE0701/LivslUtbLan/](url))

This table gives census information of Sweden, and the specific life table is about education level, sex and age by county. With Sweden being one of the happiest countries in the world for several years now perhaps we can gleam some knowledge from their statistics. I always thought education level played a part in happiness and this could help figure out if that is the case.

## **Other Data resources**

**Free resource on Sklearn for machine learning in python** ([https://nbviewer.org/github/jakevdp/sklearn_scipy2013/tree/master/notebooks/](url)) with Instructors:
1. Gael Varoquaux @GaelVaroquaux | http://gael-varoquaux.info
2. Olivier Grisel @ogrisel | http://ogrisel.com
3. Jake VanderPlas @jakevdp | http://jakevdp.github.com

This is interesting to be because with just my little experience sklearn in python I know how valuable it can be data sets especially for machine learning. It can run linear regression, k neighbors classifier and decision trees easily. I believe this could be the best place to start learning how to get knowledge from your data and would like to be far more proficient in it.
